// The Charge Point SHALL respond with a UpdateFirmwareConfirmation. The Charge Point SHOULD start retrieving the firmware as soon as possible after retrieve-date.
// During downloading and installation of the firmware, the Charge Point MUST send FirmwareStatusNotificationRequest payloads to keep the Central System updated with the status of the update process.

// If it is not possible to continue charging during installation of firmware, it is RECOMMENDED to wait until Charging Session has ended (Charge Point idle) before commencing installation.
// It is RECOMMENDED to set connectors that are not in use to UNAVAILABLE while the Charge Point waits for the Session to end.
