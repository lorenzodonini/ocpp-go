// When a EV driver calls the CPO help-desk, an operator could manually trigger the sending of an UnlockConnectorRequest to the Charge Point, forcing a new attempt to unlock the connector.
// Hopefully this time the connector unlocks and the EV driver can unplug the cable and drive away.
// The UnlockConnectorRequest SHOULD NOT be used to remotely stop a running transaction, use the Remote Stop Transaction instead.
// Upon receipt of an UnlockConnectorRequest, the Charge Point SHALL respond with a UnlockConnectorConfirmation.
// The response payload SHALL indicate whether the Charge Point was able to unlock its connector.
// If there was a transaction in progress on the specific connector, then Charge Point SHALL finish the transaction first as described in Stop Transaction.
