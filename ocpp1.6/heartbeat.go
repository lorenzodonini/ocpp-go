// To let the Central System know that a Charge Point is still connected, a Charge Point sends a heartbeat after a configurable time interval.
// The Charge Point SHALL send a HeartbeatRequest for ensuring that the Central System knows that a Charge Point is still alive.
// Upon receipt of a Heartbeat.req PDU, the Central System SHALL respond with a HeartbeatConfirmation.
// The response payload SHALL contain the current time of the Central System, which is RECOMMENDED to be used by the Charge Point to synchronize its internal clock.
// The Charge Point MAY skip sending a HeartbeatRequest when another payload has been sent to the Central System within the configured heartbeat interval.
// This implies that a Central System SHOULD assume availability of a Charge Point whenever a request has been received, the same way as it would have, when it received a HeartbeatRequest.
// With JSON over WebSocket, sending heartbeats is not mandatory. However, for time synchronization it is advised to at least send one heartbeat per 24 hour.
